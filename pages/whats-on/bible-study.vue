            <strong>Wednesday at 7:30 pm</strong> – We value the Bible as God’s Word and meet each week to study it and learn from its teaching. </p> 
            <p> We also spend time in prayer, seeking God’s help in all that we do as a church and praying for the advance of the Gospel (the good news about Jesus) around the world.
